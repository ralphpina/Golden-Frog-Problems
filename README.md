Golden-Frog-Problems
====================

Each of the two files ReverseArray.java and IncrementByTwo.java has comments explaining what I did.

To run the problems:
------
1) Download or clone the repo.

2) In your local machine cd into the directory with the files (should be /path/where/downloaded/Golden-Frog-Problems)

3) run each one:

$ java ReverseArray

$ java IncrementByTwo
